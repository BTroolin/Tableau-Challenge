# Tableau-Challenge
This repository contains Tableau files of my analysis of CitiBike ridership in New York City from January through March of 2014.
Some trends I observed are:
  * The ridership is overwhelmingly male
  * The average age of riders is around 30 years old
  * Ridership seems to be highest along the western end of Manhattan, while other large intersections across the city have ridership higher than their neighboring locations on smaller streets. 

Tableau files need the Tableau desktop software to be viewed; there is a free version on the tableau website.
